= TODO

This test suite has grown organically over time and so is not particularly well curated or well structured.
There is lots of copy and paste.

1. Refactor tests to a standard set of templates and a single set of configuration options.
2. Rewrite using a proper automation framework such as Jenkins/Ansible/...
3. Write a front-end to show data.
