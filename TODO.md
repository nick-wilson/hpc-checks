= TODO

This test suite has grown organically over time and so is not particularly well curated or well structured.
There are lots of instances of copy and paste.

In addition to increasing the breadth of checks the following issues require attention:
1. Refactor tests to a standard set of templates and a single set of configuration options.
2. Rewrite using a proper automation framework such as Jenkins/Ansible/...
3. Write a front-end to show data.
